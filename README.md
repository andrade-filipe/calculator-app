# CalculatorApp - Front-End [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=typescript,angular,html,css)](https://skillicons.dev)
<p>This is the Front-end for my Calculator Project, the back-end is in: https://github.com/andrade-filipe/calculator-back-end</p>
<p>Made with TypeScript and Angular</p>
<p>The Goal is to do a simple calculator that makes the calculations at the API</p>

## Features
<p>DisplayComponent: Keeps the mathematical expression updated to the user ✔️</p>
<p>PadComponent: User has the option to interact with a virtual keyboard ✔️</p>
<p>CalculatorComponent: Organizes Display and Pad to the view, also connects the other child components ✔️</p>
<p>CalculatorService: Communicate with the API ✔️</p>
<p>AppState Interface: is used to show the user if all was loaded correctly from the API ✔️</p>
<ul>
    <li>Robust Error Handlers  ✔️</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Wrong Characters  ✔️</li>
    <li>Certificate if Mathematical expression being sent to the back-end is valid  ✔️</li>
    <li>Could not connect with API ✔️</li>
    <li>HTTP Interceptor ✔️</li>
    <li>Snack-Bar shows that the system failed to the user ✔️</li>
    <li>RxJs reactive error handler operators for asyncronous elements ✔️</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

## Update
<p>Permit the user to type the expression through the keyboard (not just the virtual one) and correctly send to the API ✔️</p>
<p>Permit the user to solve the expression pressing Enter key 🔴</p>

## Bug
<p>--> Sometimes <-- you have to click 2 times to clear, solve, or digit through the virtual pad 🔴</p>
